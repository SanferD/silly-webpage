# silly-webpage
A static webpage built using HTML and CSS.
All content was taken from wikipedia or just google images.
The point of this project was to finish chapter 90 of _A Smarter Way to Learn HTML & CSS_ by Mark Meyers.
The webpage is about Minnesota and has three tabs: Home, Landmarks, and Sports.
To load, use home.html.
